# senator-timeline
Timeline project for the Senator (tree)

# Overview
This project uses the Google [Timeline] (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/timeline) chart to capture world events across the lifespan of [the Senator] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senator_%28tree%29).

## Notes
The timeline chart does not handle the transition from BC to AD well, so we will be splitting the data into at least two segments (possibly more if needed for readability).
